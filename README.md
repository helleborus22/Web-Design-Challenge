# Web-Design-Challenge
I used HTML and CSS to create a website featuring the Latitude vs. X analysis of weather.

I also used the Bootstrap navbar component for the header on every page, the Bootstrap grid for responsiveness on the comparison page, and the Bootstrap table component for the data page.

Navbar has a working dropdown with links to plot pages on every page and it collapses when the window is reduced in size.

The website works at all window widths
